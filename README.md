# Kuliza-JS-Assignment

This assigmnet is on JSON data manipulation.
It has been made using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and Vanilla JS.

As the dev-dependency it mainly uses gulp.js (and some tasks that I defined in the *gulpfile.js*).
I have used the CSS float model for styling the page.
Also have tried to make the page responsive.

## Steps to run:

* Clone the repository
* Open the project in the command-line and type: `npm install`
* Once this is done type: `npm start`
